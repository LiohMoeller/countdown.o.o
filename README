Working with the repo in GitHub
------------------------------------

On github world : origin link to your forked repository, and we
standarized the name of the original to upstream by convention.

First, create a fork of openSUSE branding repo, here you have a guide: 
https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo 

Then clone your fork in your PC:

  git clone https://github.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/countdown.o.o.git

and add the original repository as remote:

  cd countdown.o.o
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/openSUSE/countdown.o.o.git

Fetch the original content and checkout/merge the branch you want to work on:
(advanced you can work on you own branch, but for simplicity here we will stick on master)
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout -b master
  git merge upstream master

Now you can work with your local branch.

  Add files, rename, remove etc ....
  if you want to see the result you can render the png by running ./render.py output_dir on you 
  own computer.

to check what you've changed 

  git status


To commit your changes to your fork, do:

  if you have untracked file ( shown as is with git status )
  just add them with git -a 
  
# Example 
git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 3 commits.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#       README
# nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
  git add README

Then to record your changes in the local repository
  git commit -a -m "A useful description (eventually bnc#NR) describing what change"
      (use -a if all the changes are relatives to the same commit)

Now time to update your fork on github      
   git push 


Then you can create a pull request you have a guide here : 
https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request

If you want to sync with upstream changes, do a:
 git fetch upstream
 git merge upstream master

 (this action is manually what git pull will do if setup)
